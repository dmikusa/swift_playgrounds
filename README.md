# Swift Playgrounds

This is a collection of Swift playgrounds that I included in my presentation at the [2015 MacAdmins Conference at     Penn State University](http://macadmins.psu.edu/).

It includes playgrounds that show basic Swift, JSON parsing, sending HTTP requests and doing basic file IO.

## Usage

Open the workspace in XCode.  You can open the playgrounds directly, but they depend on some frameworks which are included with the workspace.
