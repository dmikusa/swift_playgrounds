# Swift Playgrounds

This is a collection of Swift playgrounds that I included in my presentation at the [2015 MacAdmins Conference at     Penn State University](http://macadmins.psu.edu/).

It includes playgrounds that show basic Swift, JSON parsing, sending HTTP requests and doing basic file IO.

## Usage

1. Clone the repo.  `git clone --recursive https://github.com/dmikusa/swift_playgrounds.git`
2. Open the workspace in XCode.  Wait for it to index everything.
3. In the Schema selector, pick SwiftyJSON -> My Mac.  Go to the Project menu and pick Build.  Repeat for Just-OSX -> My Mac and Alamofire OSX -> My Mac.  This will build the frameworks used by the projects.
4. Select a playground or go to Editor -> Execute Playground to refresh it.

Note:  You only need to perform the first three steps once.  After that, you can edit the playgrounds as much as you want.
